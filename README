NAME
    App::Genpass - Quickly create secure passwords

VERSION
    Version 0.03

SYNOPSIS
        use App::Genpass;

        my $genpass = App::Genpass->new();
        print $genpass->generate, "\n";

        $genpass = App::Genpass->new( readable => 0, length => 20 );
        print map { "$_\n" } $genpass->generate(10);

DESCRIPTION
    If you've ever needed to create 10 (or even 10,000) passwords on the fly
    with varying preferences (lowercase, uppercase, no confusing characters,
    special characters, minimum length, etc.), you know it can become a
    pretty pesky task.

    This script makes it possible to create flexible and secure passwords,
    quickly and easily.

    At some point it will support configuration files.

SUBROUTINES/METHODS
  new
    Creates a new instance. It gets a lot of options.

  generate
    This method generates the password.
